# AKF_GAM207_ArenaPrototype

A fast-paced arena shooter prototype developed in Unreal Engine 5 as part of the GAM 207: Information Technology and Digital Games course at Southern New Hampshire University.

This project focuses on implementing core gameplay systems and exploring iterative design within a scoped prototype.

---

## Project Overview

This prototype was created as a final course project and showcases foundational gameplay systems built in Unreal Engine using Blueprint scripting. The emphasis is on mechanics, interaction, and system integration rather than visual polish.

Key systems implemented include:

- Player character with third-person movement and shooting mechanics
- Enemy AI featuring basic navigation, pursuit, and attack behavior
- Core gameplay loop including health management and combat triggers
- HUD elements displaying player health, ammo, and game state
- Interactive pickups such as health and power-up items

This project demonstrates an understanding of Unreal Engine workflows, gameplay logic, and iterative system development.
