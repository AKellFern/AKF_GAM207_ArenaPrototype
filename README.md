# AKF GAM207 Arena Prototype

*A fast-paced arena shooter prototype developed in Unreal Engine 5 for GAM 207: Information Technology and Digital Games at SNHU.*

## 🎮 Project Overview

This prototype was created as the final project for the GAM 207 course at Southern New Hampshire University. It showcases core gameplay systems built in Unreal Engine using Blueprint scripting, including:

- 🚶‍♂️ **Player Character**: Third-person controller with responsive movement and shooting mechanics.
- 🤖 **AI Character**: Enemy behavior including basic navigation, pursuit, and attack logic.
- 🎯 **Game Logic**: Functional gameplay loop including health systems and combat triggers.
- 🧩 **HUD/Interface**: Custom UI for player health, ammo, and game status.
- 💎 **Pickups**: Power-ups, health items, or other interactive objects that enhance gameplay.

This project demonstrates a foundational understanding of game development principles, Unreal Engine 5 tooling, and iterative game design.

## 🧪 Technologies Used
